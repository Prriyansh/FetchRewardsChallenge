## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Network Requests
- Uses Retrofit for API communication.  
- The API response is deserialized into `Item` objects using Gson.  

### Data Processing
-  Null or Empty Names: These are removed from the dataset.  
-  Sorting Order: Data is sorted **first by `listId` (ascending)** and then **by `name` (ascending, case-sensitive)**.  

### User Interface
- RecyclerView efficiently renders the list of items.

## ⚠️ Edge Cases Considered
- Null or Empty Names: These are removed before displaying the list.  
- Sorting Consistency: Ensures reliable ordering of data.  
- API Failures: Displays an error message if the network request fails.  
- Performance Optimization: Uses `RecyclerView` with ViewHolder pattern for smooth scrolling.
